# Data Structures and algorithm
Contains jupyter notebooks for technical interview and problem solving challenges.

All the notebooks are divided into the following cateogry - 
1. ### Algorithm
 > algo

 General classification of algorithms are - 
 * Divide and Conquer
 * Greedy
    * Knapsack (Fractional)
    * Job Sequencing with deadline
    * Optimal Merge Pattern (Huffman Coding)
    * Minimum Spanning Tree (Prims and Kruskal)
 * Dynamic Programming
 * Backtracking
 * Branch and Bound
